# Omnipaxos-kv
This is an example repo showcasing the use of the [Omnipaxos](https://omnipaxos.com) consensus library to create a simple distributed key-value store. The source can be used to build server and client binaries which communicate over TCP. The repo also contains a benchmarking example which delploys Omnipaxos servers and clients onto [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) instances and runs an experiment collecting client response latencies (see `benchmarks/README.md`).

# Prerequisites
 - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

# How to run
The `build_scripts` directory contains various utilities for configuring and running OmniPaxos clients and servers. Also contains examples of TOML file configuration.
 - `run-local-client.sh` runs two clients in separate local processes. Configuration such as which server to connect to defined in TOML files.
 - `run-local-cluster.sh` runs a 3 server cluster in separate local processes.
 - `docker-compose.yml` docker compose for a 3 server cluster.
 - See `benchmarks/README.md` for benchmarking scripts
